# Serverless Container Framework

**One solution to deploy serverless workloads everywhere** - Serverless Container Framework (SCF) is a unified development and deployment experience for containers on serverless platforms.

The value of SCF lies in its Heroku-like experience for deploying containers on serverless platforms, without vendor lock-in. Deploy to any container-supporting serverless platform. While PaaS providers charge hefty markups based on compute usage, SCF charges only a fixed cost per each container you deploy. Even better, SCF's license is free for every developer/organization making less than $2 million in revenue per year.

In this initial release, SCF focuses on delivering an API architecture that leverages AWS Application Load Balancer for request routing, allowing developers to freely mix and transition between AWS Lambda and AWS ECS Fargate compute options, accompanied by a rich development experience.

# Configuration

Serverless Container Framework offers simple YAML to deliver complex architectures via a `serverless.containers.yml` file. Here is a simple example of a full-stack application.

```yaml
name: acmeinc

deployment:
  type: awsApi@1.0

containers:
  # Web (Frontend)
  service-web:
    src: ./web
    routing:
      domain: acmeinc.com
      pathPattern: /*
    compute:
      type: awsLambda
  # API (Backend)
  service-api:
    src: ./api
    routing:
      domain: api.acmeinc.com
      pathPattern: /api/*
      pathHealthCheck: /health
    compute:
      type: awsFargateEcs
      awsFargateEcs:
        memory: 4096
        cpu: 1024
      environment:
        HELLO: world
      awsIam:
        customPolicy:
          Version: "2012-10-17"
          Statement:
            - Effect: Allow
              Action:
                - dynamodb:GetItem
              Resource:
                - "*"
```
